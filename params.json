Evidently and to make your task ahead easier, create a working directory and change to that location.\r\nAll the rhc commands below are relative to your working directory location.\r\n\r\nBelow, please note that I will name the application b2evo, but you can select any (allowed) name desired.\r\n\r\n`rhc app create -a b2evo -t php-5.3`\r\n\r\nOR, alternatively,\r\n\r\n`rhc app create -a b2evo -t php-5.4`\r\n\r\n(since as of January 2014, OpenShift added PHP 5.4.)\r\n\r\nA new directory named as your application (i.e. b2evo in this case) will be created at your current location. You may examine its content\r\nfor instance: ls -a b2evo/\r\n\r\nAdd mysql support to your application\r\n    \r\n`rhc cartridge add -c mysql-5.1 -a b2evo`\r\n\r\nOR, alternatively,\r\n\r\n`rhc cartridge add -c mysql-5.5 -a b2evo`\r\n\r\n(since as of January 2014, OpenShift added MySQL 5.5.)\r\n\r\nMake a note of the username, password, and host name (for reference purposes since your b2evolution instance will be provided with relevant values).\r\n\r\nAdd this upstream b2evolution quickstart repo:\r\n\r\n`cd b2evo/.`\r\n\r\n`rm -v index.php`\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n`rm -v ./*`\r\n\r\n(please note the leading dot _before_ the frontslash)\r\n\r\n`git remote add upstream -m master git://github.com/Metztli/b2evo-metztli.git`\r\n\r\n`git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master`\r\n\r\nThen push the repo upstream to OpenShift\r\n\r\n`git push`\r\n\r\nThat's it, you can now instantiate your b2evolution application at:\r\n\r\nhttp://b2evo-yourNameSpace.rhcloud.com\r\n\r\nPlease disregard if you get a message similar to:\r\n\r\n\"_You cannot use the application before you finish configuration and installation._\r\n\r\n_MySQL error:_\r\n_Table 'yourAppNameDB.evo_settings' doesn't exist(Errno=1146)_\"\r\n\r\nIt only means that the values where taken directly from your OpenShift environment.\r\n\r\nProceed to click either of the '_here_' links to finish the b2evolution install.\r\n\r\nSelect your language from the upper left cascading menu.\r\n\r\nIf you are not familiar with blogging in b2evolution, allow the preselected defaults to install three(3) sample blogs.\r\n\r\nThen press the '**GO!**'-labeled button at your lower left. Wait a couple of seconds and you will be provided with your\r\n\r\ndefault login username: _admin_\r\n\r\n**_please make a note of your random password and use it for your initial login procedure_** --you can change it upon logging in.\r\n\r\nFor security change your default login username and your email address.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nHuelmati [enjoy]!\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: of course, if you used CNAME to point your (sub)domain name to your OpenShift application, then setup your b2evolution\r\napplication by accessing your (sub)domain URL.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, if you have and want to point a domain name (or subdomain) to your b2evo application (recently created), then use form of command below:\r\n\r\nrhc alias add b2evo b2evolution.yourDomainName.xyz\r\n\r\nDon't forget that you must first modify the CNAME at your domain DNS service provider and it usually takes at least 12hours for it to propagate.\r\n\r\nThus, as an example to guide you in your CNAME settings:\r\n\r\nb2evolution.yourDomainName.xyz\t\t should point to\t\tb2evo-yourNameSpace.rhcloud.com\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n![Tlalocatecuhtli](https://www.metztli-it.com/sites/default/files/images/Atemoztli.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
