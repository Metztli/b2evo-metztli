  "body": "# b2evolution on OpenShift\r\n=========================\r\nb2evolution is a downloadable, open source (GPL licensed), powerful, free PHP engine enabling:\r\n\r\n+ CMS\r\n+ content\r\n+ blogs\r\n+ photos galleries\r\n+ community\r\n+ forums\r\n+ email marketing\r\n+ documentation\r\n\r\nWith a few clicks you can quickly install on Red Hat OpenShift online platform as a service (PaaS).\r\n\r\nb2evolution is an open source **security**-conscious, full-featured alternative *superseding* WordPress.\r\n\r\nMore information can be found on the official [b2evolution website](http://b2evolution.net).\r\n\r\n## Running on OpenShift\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nCreate an account at [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/). You will be required to create a **_namespace_**.\r\n\r\nI assume that you have installed the rhc command line tools for your operating system, as guided in Getting [Started With OpenShift](https://developers.openshift.com/en/getting-started-overview.html)\r\n\r\nCreate a PHP application. Evidently and to make your task ahead easier, create a working directory and change to that location.\r\nAll the rhc commands below are relative to your working directory location.\r\n\r\nBelow, please note that I will name the application b2evo, but you can select any (allowed) name desired.\r\n\r\n`rhc app create -a b2evo -t php-5.3`\r\n\r\nOR, alternatively,\r\n\r\n`rhc app create -a b2evo -t php-5.4`\r\n\r\n(since as of January 2014, OpenShift added PHP 5.4.)\r\n\r\nA new directory named as your application (i.e. b2evo in this case) will be created at your current location. You may examine its content for instance:\r\n\r\n`ls -a b2evo/`\r\n\r\nAdd mysql support to your application\r\n    \r\n`rhc cartridge add -c mysql-5.1 -a b2evo`\r\n\r\nOR, alternatively,\r\n\r\n`rhc cartridge add -c mysql-5.5 -a b2evo`\r\n\r\n(since as of January 2014, OpenShift added MySQL 5.5.)\r\n\r\nMake a note of the username, password, and host name (for reference purposes since your b2evolution instance will be provided with relevant values).\r\n\r\nChange to your newly created directory -- which has the same name as your app:\r\n\r\n`cd b2evo/.`\r\n\r\nAnd remove the file:\r\n\r\n`rm -v index.php`\r\n\r\nAdd this upstream b2evolution quickstart repo:\r\n\r\n`git remote add upstream -m master git://github.com/Metztli/b2evo-metztli.git`\r\n\r\nProceed with:\r\n\r\n`git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master`\r\n\r\nif it does not work, and output is similar to:\r\n\r\n\"fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories\"\r\n\r\nit means your are using git 2.9+; then try:\r\n\r\n`git pull -s recursive --allow-unrelated-histories -X theirs upstream master`\r\n\r\nA subsequent dialog or editor may be activated prompting you to '*enter a commit message*': you may simply close the dialog or editor.\r\n\r\nThen push the repo upstream to OpenShift\r\n\r\n`git push`\r\n\r\nThat's it! You can now instantiate your b2evolution application at:\r\n\r\n> http://b2evo-yourNameSpace.rhcloud.com\r\n\r\nPlease disregard if you get a message similar to:\r\n\r\n    The database is not installed yet!\r\n\r\n    The b2evolution files are present on your server, but it seems the database is not yet set up as expected.\r\n\r\n    [...]\r\n\r\n    \"You cannot use the application before you finish configuration and installation.\r\n\r\n    MySQL error:\r\n    Table 'yourAppNameDB.evo_settings' doesn't exist(Errno=1146)\"\r\n\r\n    Please use the installer to finish your configuration/installation now.\r\n\r\n    On most installations, the installer should be **here** (but I can't be sure since I have no config info available! :P)\r\n\r\nIt only means that the values were taken directly from your OpenShift environment.\r\n\r\nProceed to select (click) either the above message referenced '*here*' link OR the '*Installer*' link -- at the upper right options in the page -- to finish the b2evolution install.\r\n\r\nSelect your language from the upper left cascading menu.\r\n\r\nLeave the default radio button selected: New Install\r\n\r\nSelect rectangle labeled '**Next**' to proceed.\r\n\r\nIf you are not familiar with blogging in b2evolution, leave check mark on the 6 preselected sample collections/contents.\r\n\r\nThen press the '**INSTALL!**'-labeled button at your lower left. Wait a couple of seconds for installation to complete and you will be provided with your\r\n\r\ndefault login username: _admin_\r\n\r\nPlease make a note of your random password and use it for your initial login procedure --you can change it upon logging in.\r\n\r\nFor security change your default login username and your email address.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\n_*Huelmati*_ [_enjoy_]!\r\n\r\nNote: of course, if you used CNAME to point your (sub)domain name to your OpenShift application, then setup your b2evolution\r\napplication by accessing your (sub)domain URL.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, if you have and want to point a domain name (or subdomain) to your b2evo application (recently created), then use form of command below:\r\n\r\n`rhc alias add b2evo b2evolution.yourDomainName.xyz`\r\n\r\nDon't forget that you must first modify the CNAME at your domain DNS service provider and it usually takes at least 12hours for it to propagate.\r\n\r\nThus, as an example to guide you in your CNAME settings:\r\n\r\nb2evolution._yourDomainName.xyz_\tshould point to\t\tb2evo-_yourNameSpace_.rhcloud.com\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n![Tlalocatecuhtli](https://metztli.it/sites/default/files/images/Atemoztli.png)",
