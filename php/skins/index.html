	<h1><code>/skins</code> folder</h1>
	<p>This folder holds the <strong>skins</strong> for the front-office. Each collection may use a different skin. It may actually even use different skins for web, tablet and mobile devices.</p>
	<p>Each available skin can be found in its own sub-folder. You can install/create additional skins by copying/creating new subfolders into the <code>/skins</code> folder.</p>
	<p>Subfolders starting with a `_` represent available skins which will remain hidden to the users. Those are typically used for RSS skins.</p>
	<p><em>This folder needs to be accessed through the web.</em></p>
